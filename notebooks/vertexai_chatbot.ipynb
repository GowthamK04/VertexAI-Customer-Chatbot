But the decline in service is scary and truly hurting the reputation. Our family went to your location on Jessup Rd in Summerville, SC, the other day. We drove up to the speaker and placed our order. Drove around and there was one car. That car was there a while then they pulled around to the other side. We moved up and waited 28 minutes, and watched about 4 other cars leave. In those 28 minutes, not one employee came to the window. We watched as they were talking and laughing with each other going back and forth in the lobby. We noticed that the people who were in front of us ended up going inside. We finally drove off and went to another restaurant. Fast easy and friendly service. I truly hope you guys can save BK.
